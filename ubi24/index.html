					<h2>About This Workshop</h2>
					<div class="works-content">
                    <p>
                        With the advancement of pervasive technology, <b>Human-Information Interaction (HII)</b> has become increasingly ubiquitous. In these diverse information access devices and interfaces, it is crucial to understand and improve the user experience during human-information interaction. In recent years, we have seen a rapid uptake of physiological sensors used to estimate the cognitive aspect of the interaction. However, several challenges remain from a ubiquitous computing perspective, such as the definitions discrepancy of cognitive activities (for example, cognitive bias or information need) and the lack of standard practice for collecting and processing physiological data in information interaction. 
                        <br><br>
						This workshop aims to discuss and establish a common understanding of user experience in HII, discuss best practices to quantify with physiological sensing methods, and also reflect on potential applications and ethical issues. 
					<!-- In this workshop, we bring together researchers from different disciplines to form a common understanding of cognitive activities, discuss best practices to quantify the cognitive aspects of human-information interaction, and reflect on potential applications and ethical issues arising from physiological sensing methods. -->

					<p><b>
					Our workshop is also open for people who are new to the field ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt have prior experience but are interested to know, our workshop is a good opportunity to start (with hands-on tutorials).

						<div><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, I will present our latest methods for extracting rich information from EEG (electroencephalogram) data, one of the key physiological modalities for quantifying cognitive activity. A major challenge in EEG analysis is dealing with noise, and I will introduce a novel approach that effectively learns informative representations while maintaining robustness to noise. These robust representations can be applied to various downstream tasks, including the analysis of cognitive activities in the human brain. The second part of the talk will focus on another innovative method for classifying EEG signals in a specific application‚Äîmeasuring affective and motivational states as conditions for cognitive and metacognitive processes in self-regulated learning. Together, these advancements demonstrate the potential of EEG-based techniques for providing deeper insights into the human brain.</p></div>
