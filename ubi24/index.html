    <h2>About This Workshop</h2>

    <p>
        With the advancement of pervasive technology, information interaction has become increasingly ubiquitous. In these diverse information access devices and interfaces, it is crucial to understand and improve the user experience during human-information interaction. In recent years, we have seen a rapid uptake of physiological sensors used to estimate the cognitive aspect of the interaction. However, several challenges remain from a ubiquitous computing perspective, such as the definitions discrepancy of cognitive activities (for example, cognitive bias or information need) and the lack of standard practice for collecting and processing physiological data in human-information interaction (HII). In this workshop, we bring together researchers from different disciplines to form a common understanding of cognitive activities, discuss best practices to quantify the cognitive aspects of human-information interaction, and reflect on potential applications and ethical issues arising from physiological sensing methods.
    </p>

    <h2>Call For Papers</h2>
    <p>
    We invite researchers and practitioners who use physiological data to measure user experience in information interaction to submit their contributions as a short research summary or position paper (4 pages in the SIGCHI one-column format, excluding references) discussing one or more of the workshop themes. Each submission will be reviewed by the workshop organizers and accepted based on the quality of the submission, the potential to generate fruitful discussions, and the diversity of perspectives. Accepted submissions will be invited to give a talk at our workshop and encouraged to record a short 3-5 minutes video summarizing their work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Deadline for Workshop Paper Submissions: June 7, 2024 <br>
    Notification of Acceptance: June 28, 2024 <br>
    Workshop Date: TBC (October 5 or 6, 2024)
  </p>

    <h2>Workshop Themes</h2>
    We invite contributions that discuss about one or more of the following themes:


    <h4>Exploring and Defining Cognitive Activities in HII </h4>
    <p>
      What cognitive activities impact the interaction between humans and information? We aim to uncover cognitive activities involved in HII and build a common understanding among cross-disciplinary researchers. Previous research has investigated a diverse set of cognitive activities, e.g., relevance judgment, information satisfaction, and cognitive biases.
    </p>

    <h4>Methods to Quantify Cognitive Activities </h4>
    <p>
       What tools and modalities can quantify cognitive activities in HII? What are the ground truths, and do we need them?  How can we ensure that the collected data are ecologically valid? What are the considerations for using physiological sensors in HII settings?
     </p>

     <h4>Application Scenarios and Impacts </h4>
     <p>
        We seek to explore how cognitive activity quantification can impact human-information interaction. What kind of applications would cognitive activity quantification enable and benefit users of information systems? At the same time, what are ethical, legal, and privacy considerations arising from using physiological sensors in HII?
      </p>

    <h4>Case Studies</h4>
    <p>
       We would like to see realistic cases where the utilization of physiological signals has been adopted into research related to human-information interaction.
