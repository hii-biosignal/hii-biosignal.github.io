                    <h2>About This Workshop</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the advancement of pervasive technology, information interaction has become increasingly ubiquitous. In these diverse information access devices and interfaces, it is crucial to understand and improve the user experience during human-information interaction. In recent years, we have seen a rapid uptake of physiological sensors used to estimate the cognitive aspect of the interaction. However, several challenges remain from a ubiquitous computing perspective, such as the definitions discrepancy of cognitive activities (for example, cognitive bias or information need) and the lack of standard practice for collecting and processing physiological data in human-information interaction (HII). 
                        <br><br>In this workshop, we bring together researchers from different disciplines to form a common understanding of cognitive activities, discuss best practices to quantify the cognitive aspects of human-information interaction, and reflect on potential applications and ethical issues arising from physiological sensing methods.

                            <p>
                            What cognitive activities impact the interaction between humans and information? We aim to uncover cognitive activities involved in HII and build a common understanding among cross-disciplinary researchers. Previous research has investigated a diverse set of cognitive activities, e.g., relevance judgment, information satisfaction, and cognitive biases.

                            <p>
                               What tools and modalities can quantify cognitive activities in HII? What are the ground truths, and do we need them?  How can we ensure that the collected data are ecologically valid? What are the considerations for using physiological sensors in HII settings?

                               We seek to explore how cognitive activity quantification can impact human-information interaction. What kind of applications would cognitive activity quantification enable and benefit users of information systems? At the same time, what are ethical, legal, and privacy considerations arising from using physiological sensors in HII?
